# Machine Learning 🤖

A collection of small projects related to machine learning.

If you want a quick start with a general understanding of how to teach a program to make decisions based on your needs, you've come to the right place.

This repository was created with the idea of **learning by teaching** — building a tutorial for others who, like me, want to learn more about machine learning but never knew where to start and have no prior experience.

Below, I've listed the main content I used as a learning path. For the best experience, I recommend exploring them alongside their references and related resources.

## 📚 Learning Resources

### 🔹 Learn TensorFlow and Deep Learning Fundamentals with Python — *Daniel Bourke*

These two videos are perfect for getting a **quick, step-by-step overview**, so you don't get lost in the vast amount of machine learning content:

- [Video 1 – TensorFlow Fundamentals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpCFfeUEGs8)  
- [Video 2 – Deep Learning Fundamentals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUKz4125WNI)

### 🔹 Machine Learning — *freeCodeCamp*

This organization is by far **better than many paid courses and bootcamps**. In addition to its YouTube playlist, the official website offers a wealth of content not only on machine learning, but also on foundational topics like **mathematics** and **support tools** for ML development:

- [Full Course Playlist (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_LwzRVP7bg&list=PLWKjhJtqVAblStefaz_YOVpDWqcRScc2s&index=1)
